        <Top>Why Should Kids and Teens Learn to Code with <br />
         Tynker?</Top>

         <Hold>
            <P>Because <span>technology is so integrated</span> into virtually every aspect of our lives, learning about it is <span>more
         important than ever</span>. Our coding platform makes it convenient and fun for kids and teens to gain 
         knowledge that will serve them well throughout their lives. You can count on our <span>trusted methods</span> to 
         help them develop and grow their capabilities with computers.</P>

         <P2>Tynker isnâ€™t just for schools and coding camps, though. Parents who value <span>STEM education</span> and want 
        their children to know how to code should know that our kids programming platform can be used at 
        home, too. Tynker offers a range of solutions with icon-coding for pre-readers, block-based coding, and 
        advanced courses in Python, JavaScript, data science, art, and image processing. There are individual 
        and family home plans, and our online coding classes for all ages are an excellent way for them to gain 
        the supplemental STEM skills needed for their future.</P2>
